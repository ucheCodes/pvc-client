        <h1>Get Free Ethereum Funds</h1>
            <p>Every transaction performed on the blockchain requires some amount of money to be spent. 
                Therefore to be able to vote and use this application, the system requires that some form of digital
                fund (Token) be spent but not to worry, none of your money will be spent while using this application because
                it is just a prototype, hence all you need is also a form of prototype fund to use this application.
                 To get a prototype crypto fund on the mumbai polygon network, copy your private key from metamask, click on the button below
                 and paste your private key on the redirected address, select Matic Token to get some matic tokens which will be managed by metamask and enhance smooth transactions
                 on the blockchain then click submit.
        </p>

        <p>Configure Metamask to the mumbai polygon test network</p>
        <p>Once the two steps above are completed, go to the navigation menu, select the vote tab, provide your
                National Identification Number (NIN) then vote for your preferred candidates. Note that with your NIN and

                can only vote once.
